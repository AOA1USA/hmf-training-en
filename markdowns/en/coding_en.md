# Coding

To develop APIs or services, and know how to hack them, you need to learn how to design algorithms, and know one or more programming languages.

## Histoire du C


The C language has three ancestors: CPL, BCPL and B.

Like the BCPL, the B had only one type of data, namely the computer world. Most operators (+, -, *, /) regarded the word as an integer, while others saw it as a memory address. At other points, B can be seen as a primitive version of C

The C language was developed by Dennis Ritchie, who first thought of doing only a New B or NB. But in addition to the characters, Ritchie added the tables, the pointers, the floating-point numbers, the structures... 1972 was the most productive year of development and probably the year of baptism of C. In 1973, language C was sufficiently developed that 90% of UNIX could be rewritten with. In 1974, Bell Labs licensed UNIX licenses to universities, and the C language began to be distributed.

::: What is UNIX?
UNIX is the name of an operating system created in 1969, primarily for professional use, conceptually open and based on
approach by which it offers many small tools each with a specific mission, multitasking and multiuser
:::

From this C was born the C ++. The c ++ is an improved version and orient object of C.

### Another important language
You have to have what basic in it is language: HTML, PHP...
When you want to attack any city on the web.
The HyperText Markup Language, typically abbreviated HTML, is a markup language to write hypertext, hence its name.
It is he who will define the structure of the city.
PHP is a language usually integrated with HTML to make it more alive, that interactions can be made between the user and the page.

## Some generalities

There are several ways of designing and implementing programs. There are usually two ways. Either by using a compiler, which will transpose the source code into binary executable, directly comprehensible by the machine. Either by interpreting the code, the source code is read by an interpreter, which transposes the source code into instructions that can be understood by the computer.
